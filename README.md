# ZymeKBase
ZymeKBase is a curated knowledge base of nanozyme catalytic kinetics linking standardized endpoints (Km, kcat, Vmax) with experimental contexts and machine-learning-ready features. It enables evidence synthesis, benchmarking, and reproducible modeling with transparent provenance from literature to trained predictors.
